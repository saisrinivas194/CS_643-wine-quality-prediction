# Wine Quality Prediction Model - CS 643 Cloud Computing Assignment

This project implements a wine quality prediction model using Apache Spark and MLlib, trained in parallel on AWS EC2 instances. The model is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:
1. Parallel model training on 4 EC2 instances using Spark MLlib
2. Single-machine prediction application (with Docker container support)

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven 3.8.4 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Git

## Dataset Structure

The project uses three datasets:
- `TrainingDataset.csv`: Used for training the model
- `ValidationDataset.csv`: Used for model validation and parameter tuning
- `TestDataset.csv`: Used for testing the prediction application

## Setup Instructions

### 1. AWS Environment Setup

1. Launch 4 EC2 instances (t2.micro or larger) with Ubuntu Linux
2. Configure security groups:
   - Allow SSH (port 22)
   - Allow Spark communication (ports 7077, 8080)
   - Allow inter-instance communication
3. Set up IAM roles with S3 permissions:
   - `s3:GetObject`
   - `s3:PutObject`
   - `s3:ListBucket`
4. Install required software on all instances:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk maven
   ```

### 2. Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-prediction.git
   cd wine-prediction
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

### 3. Running the Model Training

1. Copy the JAR file to all 4 EC2 instances
2. Start Spark master on the master node:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/spark/sbin/start-master.sh
   ```
3. Start Spark workers on all nodes:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/spark/sbin/start-worker.sh spark://<master-ip>:7077
   ```
4. Run the training application:
   ```bash
   spark-submit --master spark://<master-ip>:7077 \
     --class com.example.WineModel \
     target/wine-prediction-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

### 4. Running the Prediction Application

#### Without Docker:

1. Copy the JAR file to a single EC2 instance
2. Run the prediction application:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/wine-prediction-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

#### With Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t wine-prediction .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -v /path/to/test/data:/data wine-prediction
   ```

## Model Performance

The model achieves an RMSE of 0.5515 on the validation dataset, indicating good prediction accuracy.

## Docker Hub

The Docker image is available at: [saisrinivas194/wine-prediction](https://hub.docker.com/r/saisrinivas194/wine-prediction)

You can pull the image using:
```bash
docker pull saisrinivas194/wine-prediction
```
